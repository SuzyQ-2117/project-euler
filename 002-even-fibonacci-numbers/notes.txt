Problem 2: https://projecteuler.net/problem=2

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. Starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms are:
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, …

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.



Solution - Pseudo-code:
This might not be clear psuedocode but more messy English: 

Variables f1 and f2 to track the numbers were adding together - potentially a third f3 because I can’t see how we can use two numbers to generate a third number and simultaneously move everything “along” one

If f1%2==0 && f1 < 4,000,000, add it to an array of numbers 
Then sum the total of the numbers in the array 
print the total at the end
