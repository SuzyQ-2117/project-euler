Problem 1: https://projecteuler.net/problem=1

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.



Solution - Pseudo-code:

variable to track total = 0

for number in range (1 to 1000): 
switch case?
if number % 3 == 0 or number % 5 == 0: 
total += number
print total
